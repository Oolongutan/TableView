//Caravan Black was created with strong, smoky Russian tea blends in mind. Here we've blended smoky Lapsang Souchong, dynamic Keemun, spicy cloves, and citrus. It brews a strong tea with lots of flavor—not for the faint of heart.

//The classic Chinese green tea characterized by its smoky flavor, clean finish, and rolled nugget appearance. Watch it unfurl as it steeps.

//Finally, a white tea that everyone can appreciate! Silver Needles are plucked from the freshest buds of the tea plant. The silvery-white hairs on the new growth give this tea it´s name. Flavorful and savory, Silver Needles is described by our tasters as having pleasant grassy notes.
//Cascadia Breakfast tastes like coffee came over for a cup of tea and decided to stay! A smooth, rich, and less-jittery alternative to coffee combining malty and lightly fruity black teas with the earthy robustness of coffee and Chinese puerh, finished with nutty, chocolaty notes of chicory and carob. Our careful infusion of tea with whole coffee beans ensures that the tea's flavor still shines through. While we aren't the first to think of it, we might be the first to perfect it. No grinding necessary!

//Enjoy the tastes of spring and sunshine with Bird Song Oolong, a soft and elegant blend. Its exquisite base is a Wu-yi varietal oolong, cultivated at low elevations in central Taiwan. Lightly oxidized and roasted, this tea reveals natural floral and herbaceous notes. We have enhanced the blend with fragrant rose petals, chamomile blossoms, and fruity lemon balm, offering a delightful balance of flavors. Enjoy Bird Song iced during hot summer months, with a slice of lemon for a refreshing twist.

//This tasty selection is composed of cooked puerh (pronounced POO-ar) scented with an herb (Nuo Mi Xiang) that tastes just like aromatic sticky rice. The resulting flavor is smooth, earthy, and very pleasant. Tea tasters have described it as "mushroomy". The rice scent makes this tuocha a great flavor accompaniment to a hearty meal.

//Chinese green tea blended with refreshing spearmint and orange zest. Reminiscent of traditional Moroccan mint teas.

//Berry White Tea is an irresistible fusion crafted for all palates to savor. Featuring a harmonious blend of delicate white peony (Chinese Bai Mudan) tea, perfectly paired with jasmine green tea and chamomile, and infused with the essence of blueberry and peach. Fragrant and delightful, each sip as aromatic and satisfying. Berry White Tea shines equally as a refreshing hot brew or an invigorating iced tea. A beautiful introduction for those new to white and green teas.

//We are excited to reintroduce the well-loved Dream blend! It still delivers the powerful relaxation benefits that promote a good night's sleep, but we've made it even better by increasing the amount of valerian root and incorporating fragrant linden flowers. This carefully crafted blend is specifically designed to soothe nerves and help you unwind, allowing you to simmer down and ease into a dreamy state of relaxation.

//Indulge in the rich, velvety warmth of our Cocoa Rouge Herbal Tea, a seasonal favorite perfect for cozying up during the cooler months. This decadent blend combines earthy cacao nibs, roasted chicory, and rooibos to create a full-bodied, satisfying tea that feels like a hug in a cup. With a hint of sweetness from natural vanilla and the smooth, chocolatey depth of carob, Cocoa Rouge is the ultimate treat for tea lovers who crave something indulgent without being overly sweet.

//This rare golden leaf tea goes through a smothering process referred to as "sealing yellow". What unfolds in the cup is a light buttery brew with hints of fruity green skins and sweet spun sugar.
